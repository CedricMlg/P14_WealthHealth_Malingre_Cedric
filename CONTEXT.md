# WealthHealth project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

You work for the technology department of a large financial company, WealthHealth. 

This company uses an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee records. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to considerable bugs and increased internal complaints. Your development team has been trying to upgrade the application for some time.

### My role

For this project I had the code of the app I was supposed to update in React and a link to the plugins used in the app.

I had to build the project on React, create two different pages, handle the states of my application and change the style if needed.

I also had to create my own React component lib using npm, to import others React lib to replace the JQuery plugins used before and to use Lighthouse to measure the difference in perfermances between the JQuery and the React app.
